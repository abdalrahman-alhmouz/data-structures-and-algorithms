 # linked List  Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
 * we need to write a method that accept int number then return  the number in the  position value of the number in  linkedList ,frome last to start  .## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Create a metod returnValue that accepts a number within this method, check if the linksList is not null and the value is greater than zero.
     then create another while loop to loop until reached the next head equal to null   ,
Then check if the valueis larger than the length of the  linkedLIST Then invert another loop to get to this position.
Finally, return the value of h.
 .
